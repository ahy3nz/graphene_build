# Aggregation studies
* Observing which molecules demonstrate a preference for graphene
* Set up is a mixture of gmx utilities to pack the system and 
mbuild to organize the topology
* Mdp files include NPT and annealing
* Analysis script observes chol/dopc distance from the graphene, molecule-by-molecule
