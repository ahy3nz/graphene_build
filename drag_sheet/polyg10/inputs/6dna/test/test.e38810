GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2018.1
Executable:   /raid6/software/gromacs_2018.1//bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /raid6/software/gromacs_2018.1/
Working dir:  /raid6/homes/ahy3nz/Trajectories/charmm/polyg10/inputs/6dna/test
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -ntomp 8 -gpu_id 0 -ntmpi 1 -deffnm test


Back Off! I just backed up test.log to ./#test.log.1#
Reading file test.tpr, VERSION 2018.1 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 40 to 80, rlist from 1.279 to 1.387

Using 1 MPI thread
Using 8 OpenMP threads 

1 GPU auto-selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 GPU tasks in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0,PME:0

NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cores
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin threads to cores.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).

Back Off! I just backed up test_pullx.xvg to ./#test_pullx.xvg.1#

Back Off! I just backed up test_pullf.xvg to ./#test_pullf.xvg.1#

Back Off! I just backed up test.xtc to ./#test.xtc.1#

Back Off! I just backed up test.edr to ./#test.edr.1#
