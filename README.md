# Graphene build scripts
## Free_float  
Constructs a bilayer-dna-graphene-water-ion system with the graphene sheet
oriented in line with the bilayer normal, "corner first"
## Drag_sheet  
Constructs a bilayer-dna-graphene-water-ion system with the graphene arbitrarily
rotated via `graphene_rotations.py`. Corresponding MDP file also written
based on the graphene rotation and angle of attack.
